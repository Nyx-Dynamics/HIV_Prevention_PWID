            HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND) affect up to 50\% of people living with HIV (PLWH), even in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV-DNA can be detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of approximately half of aviremic ART-suppressed PLWH and its presence is associated with poorer neurocognitive performance. HIV DNA + and HIV RNA + cells have also been observed in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with sustained cART suppression. In this review, we provide an overview of how HIV invades the brain and HIV infection of resident brain glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). We also discuss the role of resident glial cells in persistent neuroinflammation and HAND in PLWH and their potential contribution to the HIV reservoir. HIV eradication strategies that target persistently infected glia cells will likely be needed to achieve HIV cure.},

	abstract = {In 2001, Friedman et al. conjectured the existence of a “firewall effect” in which individuals who are infected with HIV, but remain in a state of low infectiousness, serve to prevent the virus from spreading. To evaluate this historical conjecture, we develop a new graph-theoretic measure that quantifies the extent to which Friedman’s firewall hypothesis (FH) holds in a risk network. We compute this new measure across simulated trajectories of a stochastic discrete dynamical system that models a social network of 25,000 individuals engaging in risk acts over a period of 15 years. The model’s parameters are based on analyses of data collected in prior studies of the real-world risk networks of people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City. Analysis of system trajectories reveals the structural mechanisms by which individuals with mature HIV infections tend to partition the network into homogeneous clusters (with respect to infection status) and how uninfected clusters remain relatively stable (with respect to infection status) over long stretches of time. We confirm the spontaneous emergence of network firewalls in the system and reveal their structural role in the nonspreading of HIV.},

Inf. Diseases 11, 289-98). We start off with a brief literature survey and review; this is followed up by a detailed description of Kaplan's model. We then outline a more realistic extension of Kaplan's model. Then we perform an equilibrium and stability analysis on this model. We find that there is a critical threshold parameter Rzero which determines the behaviour of the model. If Rzero {\textless} or = 1 there is a unique disease-free equilibrium, and if Rzero {\textless} 1 the disease dies out. If Rzero {\textgreater} 1 this disease-free equilibrium is unstable, and in addition there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally stable. If a certain condition is satisfied (and for Kaplan's model this condition is always satisfied), additional complete global-stability results are shown. These results are confirmed and explored further by simulation.},
