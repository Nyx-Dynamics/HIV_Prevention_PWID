	abstract = {Objectives:
              National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) conducts surveillance among key populations, including persons who inject drugs (PWID). NHBS data can be used to monitor progress toward national goals, including Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). EHE strategies include HIV testing (Diagnose), rapid linkage to HIV treatment (Treat), and increasing access to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and syringe services programs (SSPs) (Prevent). This analysis aimed to concisely compare NHBS key findings among PWID to EHE goals.
            
            
              Design/methods:
              
                Cross-sectional NHBS data were collected from PWID in 2018 (
                n
                 = 9786) and 2022 (
                n
                 = 6574) in 19 US cities. We compared key findings from 2022 NHBS to specified EHE goals for Diagnose (HIV testing) and Treat (linkage to care, current antiretroviral therapy (ART) use) or 2018 NHBS key findings for Prevent (PrEP and SSP use).
              
            
            
              Results:
              In 2022, 45\% of PWID were tested for HIV; 45\% of PWID with HIV were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis, and 79\% were currently taking ART; 1\% of PWID without HIV used PrEP; and approximately half of all PWID received syringes from an SSP. PrEP and SSP use among PWID have not changed since 2018.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              National HIV strategies are not yet adequately reaching PWID. To end the US HIV epidemic, multilevel solutions are needed to tailor interventions for PWID and dismantle barriers to testing, treatment, and prevention. Structural solutions to improve access to basic needs and SSPs may have downstream benefits across the EHE strategies.},

	abstract = {This editorial review covers current trends in the epidemiology of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, including four recent HIV outbreaks. We discuss gaps in the prevention and treatment cascades for HIV and medications for opioid disorder and propose lessons learned to prevent future HIV outbreaks. Over the last decade, North America has been in the throes of a major opioid epidemic, due in part to over-prescribing of prescription opiates, followed by increasing availability of cheap heroin, synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl), and stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine). Historically, HIV infection among PWID in the US had predominantly affected communities who were older, urban and Black. More recently, the majority of these infections are among younger, rural or suburban and Caucasian PWID. All four HIV outbreaks were characterized by a high proportion of women who inject drugs and underlying socioeconomic drivers such as homelessness and poverty. We contend that the US response to the HIV epidemic among PWID has been fractured. A crucial lesson is that when evidence-based responses to HIV prevention are undermined or abandoned because of moral objections, untold humanitarian and financial costs on public health will ensue. Restructuring a path forward requires that evidence-based interventions be integrated and brought to scale while simultaneously addressing underlying structural drivers of HIV and related syndemics. Failing to do so will mean that HIV outbreaks among PWID and the communities they live in will continue to occur in a tragic and relentless cycle.},

              Background
              We conducted a medical record review for healthcare utilization, risk factors, and clinical data among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Massachusetts to aid HIV outbreak response decision-making and strengthen public health practice.
            
            
              Setting
              Two large community health centers (CHCs) that provide HIV and related services in northeastern Massachusetts.
            
            
              Methods
              Between May and July 2018, we reviewed medical records for 88 people with HIV (PWH) connected to the outbreak. The review period included care received from May 1, 2016, through the date of review. Surveillance data were used to establish date of HIV diagnosis and assess viral suppression.
            
            
              Results
              Sixty-nine (78\%) people had HIV infection diagnosed during the review period, including 10 acute infections. Persons had a median of 3 primary care visits after HIV diagnosis and zero before diagnosis. During the review period, 72\% reported active drug or alcohol use, 62\% were prescribed medication assisted treatment, and 41\% were prescribed antidepressants. The majority (68, 77\%) had a documented ART prescription. HIV viral suppression at {\textless} 200 copies/mL was more frequent (73\%) than the overall across the State (65\%); it did not correlate with any of the sociodemographic characteristics studied in our population. Over half (57\%) had been hospitalized at least once during the review period, and 36\% had a bacterial infection at hospitalization.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Medical record review with a field investigation of an outbreak provided data about patterns of health care utilization and comorbidities not available from routine HIV surveillance or case interviews. Integration of HIV screening with treatment for HIV and SUD can strengthen prevention and care services for PWID in northeastern Massachusetts.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              A recent HIV outbreak in a rural network of persons who inject drugs (PWID) underscored the intersection of the expanding epidemics of opioid abuse, unsterile injection drug use (IDU), and associated increases in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We sought to identify US communities potentially vulnerable to rapid spread of HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high rates of HCV infections among PWID.
            
            
              Design:
              We conducted a multistep analysis to identify indicator variables highly associated with IDU. We then used these indicator values to calculate vulnerability scores for each county to identify which were most vulnerable.
            
            
              Methods:
              We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 2012–2013, as a proxy outcome for IDU, and 15 county-level indicators available nationally in Poisson regression models to identify indicators associated with higher county acute HCV infection rates. Using these indicators, we calculated composite index scores to rank each county's vulnerability.
            
            
              Results:
              A parsimonious set of 6 indicators were associated with acute HCV infection rates (proxy for IDU): drug-overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales, per capita income, white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, unemployment, and buprenorphine prescribing potential by waiver. Based on these indicators, we identified 220 counties in 26 states within the 95th percentile of most vulnerable.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our analysis highlights US counties potentially vulnerable to HIV and HCV infections among PWID in the context of the national opioid epidemic. State and local health departments will need to further explore vulnerability and target interventions to prevent transmission.},

            Prevention of HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs remains a challenge to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The first legal syringe services program (SSP) in Florida implemented routine screening in 2018 leading to the identification of ten anonymous HIV seroconversions. The SSP collaborated with the Department of Health to conduct an epidemiologic investigation. All seven acute HIV seroconversions were linked to care (86\% within 30 days) and achieved viral suppression (mean 70 days). Six of the seven individuals are epidemiologically and/or socially linked to at least two other seroconversions. Analysis of the HIV genotypes revealed that two individuals are connected molecularly at 0.5\% genetic distance. We identified a risk network with complex transmission dynamics that could not be explained by epidemiological methods or molecular analyses alone. Providing wrap-around services through the SSP, including routine screening, intensive linkage and patient navigation, could be an effective model for achieving viral suppression for people who inject drugs.

            Resumen
            La prevención de brotes de VIH entre las personas que se inyectan drogas sigue siendo un desafío para poner fin a la epidemia de VIH en los Estados Unidos. El primer programa legal de servicios de intercambio de jeringas (SSP como se conoce con sus siglas en inglés) en Florida, implementó pruebas rutinarias en 2018 que condujo a la identificación de diez seroconversiones anónimas de VIH. El SSP colaboró ​​con el Departamento de Salud para realizar una investigación epidemiológica. Siete seroconversiones agudas de VIH fueron identificadas y se vincularon a la atención médica (86\% en 30 días) y lograron la supresión viral (media 70 días). Seis de los siete individuos están vinculados epidemiológicamente y/o socialmente con al menos otras dos seroconversiones. El análisis de los genotipos del VIH reveló que dos individuos están conectados molecularmente a una distancia genética de 0.5\%. Identificamos una red de riesgo con una dinámica de transmisión compleja que no puede explicarse solamente con métodos epidemiológicos o análisis moleculares. Brindando servicios integrales a través del SSP, que incluyan pruebas de rutina, el enlace intensivo y la navegación del paciente, podría ser un modelo eficaz para lograr la supresión viral de las personas que se inyectan drogas.},

Longstanding strategies to reduce HIV incidence, including syringe service programs, condom distribution, medications for opioid use disorder, and low-barrier HIV testing and treatment have not been adequate to eliminate transmission in this population. Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an evidence-based intervention that reduces HIV incidence among PWID, uptake in PWID has lagged due to limited PrEP knowledge, discrepancies between perceived and actual HIV risk, stigma, and structural barriers to adherence including homelessness and incarceration. In our efforts to deploy PrEP to PWID in our low-barrier substance use disorder bridge clinic, we have encountered another barrier: the HIV testing window period. We discuss challenges in delivering HIV exposure prophylaxis to the highest risk PWID, our current approach, and the need for more data to guide best practices.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is clinically efficacious and recommended for HIV prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID), but uptake remains low and intervention needs are understudied. To inform the development of PrEP interventions for PWID, we conducted a qualitative study in the Northeastern USA, a region where recent clusters of new HIV infections have been attributed to injection drug use.
METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 33 HIV-uninfected PWID (hereafter, "participants") and 12 clinical and social service providers (professional "key informants") in Boston, MA, and Providence, RI, in 2017. Trained interviewers used semi-structured interviews to explore PrEP acceptability and perceived barriers to use. Thematic analysis of coded data identified multilevel barriers to PrEP use among PWID and related intervention strategies.
RESULTS: Among PWID participants (n = 33, 55\% male), interest in PrEP was high, but both participants and professional key informants (n = 12) described barriers to PrEP utilization that occurred at one or more socioecological levels. Individual-level barriers included low PrEP knowledge and limited HIV risk perception, concerns about PrEP side effects, and competing health priorities and needs due to drug use and dependence. Interpersonal-level barriers included negative experiences with healthcare providers and HIV-related stigma within social networks. Clinical barriers included poor infrastructure and capacity for PrEP delivery to PWID, and structural barriers related to homelessness, criminal justice system involvement, and lack of money or identification to get prescriptions. Participants and key informants provided some suggestions for strategies to address these multilevel barriers and better facilitate PrEP delivery to PWID.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to some of the facilitators of PrEP use identified by participants and key informants, we drew on our key findings and behavioral change theory to propose additional intervention targets. In particular, to help address the multilevel barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence, we discuss ways that interventions could target information, self-regulation and self-efficacy, social support, and environmental change. PrEP is clinically efficacious and has been recommended for PWID; thus, development and testing of strategies to improve PrEP delivery to this high-risk and socially marginalized population are needed.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13722-024-00502-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Addiction medicine providers have a key role in HIV prevention amidst rising HIV incidence in persons who inject drugs (PWID). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are vastly underutilized in this population. Inpatient hospitalization represents a potential touchpoint for initiation of HIV prophylaxis, though little research explores the role of addiction providers. Here we describe rates of PrEP/PEP delivery to hospitalized PWID seen by an Addiction Consult Service (ACS) at an urban, essential hospital.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients who were seen by the ACS from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 and had plausible injection drug use. We calculated the proportion of patients who received a new prescription for PrEP/PEP at discharge. We used descriptive statistics to characterize demographics, substance use, reason for admission, and indications for PrEP/PEP. Secondarily, we calculated the monthly proportion of all patients discharged from the hospital with PrEP/PEP who were seen by the ACS compared to those not seen by the ACS.
RESULTS: The average monthly proportion of ACS consults with plausible injection drug use who received PrEP/PEP was 6.4\%. This increased from 4.2\% in 2020 to 7.5\% in 2022. Those seen by the ACS who received PrEP/PEP had high rates of opioid use disorder (97.5\%), stimulant use disorder (77.8\%), and homelessness (58.1\%); over half were admitted for an injection-related infection. The indications for PrEP/PEP were injection drug use only (70.6\%), followed by combined injection and sexual risk (20.2\%); 71.9\% of prescriptions were for PrEP and 28.1\% for PEP. Overall, the ACS was involved in 83.9\% of hospital-wide discharges with PrEP/PEP prescriptions (n = 242).
CONCLUSIONS: PWID who were seen by the ACS received PrEP/PEP prescriptions at rates exceeding national averages. The ACS was also involved with the care of the majority of admitted patients who received PrEP/PEP at discharge. While PrEP/PEP use for PWID remains low, the inpatient ACS represents a key resource to improve uptake by leveraging the reachable moment of an inpatient hospitalization.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12879-018-2964-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) constitute 60\% of the approximately 5 million people in the U.S. infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment of PWID is complex due to addiction, mental illness, poverty, homelessness, lack of positive social support, poor adherence-related skills, low motivation and knowledge, and poor access to and trust in the health care system. New direct-acting antiviral medications are available for HCV with high cure rates and few side effects. The life expectancy and economic benefits of new HCV treatments will not be realized unless we determine optimal models of care for the majority of HCV-infected patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of directly observed therapy and group treatment compared with self-administered individual treatment in a large, urban opioid agonist therapy clinic setting in the Bronx, New York.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial 150 PWID with chronic HCV were recruited from opioid agonist treatment (OAT) clinics and randomized to one of three models of onsite HCV treatment in OAT: 1) modified directly observed therapy; 2) group treatment; or 3) control - self-administered individual treatment. Participants were age 18 or older, HCV genotype 1, English or Spanish speaking, treatment naïve (or treatment experienced after 12/3/14), willing to receive HCV treatment onsite, receiving methadone or buprenorphine at the medication window at least once per week, and able to provide informed consent. Outcomes of interest include adherence (as measured by self-report and electronic blister packs), HCV treatment completion, sustained virologic response, drug resistance, and cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: This paper describes the design and rationale of a randomized controlled trial comparing three models of care for HCV therapy delivered in an opioid agonist treatment program. Our trial will be critical to rigorously identify models of care that result in high adherence and cure rates. Use of blister pack technology will help us determine the role of adherence in successful cure of HCV. Moreover, the trial methodology outlined here can serve as a template for the development of future programs and studies among HCV-infected drug users receiving opioid agonist therapy, as well as the cost-effectiveness of such programs.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01857245 ). Trial registration was obtained prospectively on May 20th, 2013.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Internationally, supervised injection facilities (SIFs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing rates of overdose and promoting entry into treatment among persons who inject drugs (PWID); however, they remain unavailable in the United States. Early findings examining American PWID illustrate high overall willingness to use SIFs. The current study expands upon this research by examining PWID's likelihood to use SIFs based on services offered (eg, provides clean needles, linkage to treatment programs) and whether known risk factors (prior overdose, homelessness) influence PWID's willingness to use a SIF.
METHODS: Participants (n = 184) were patients entering short-term inpatient opioid withdrawal management in Massachusetts between May 2018 and February 2019 who reported injection drug use in the prior 30 days. We examined PWID's likelihood to use a SIF if eight unique services were available, and compared if this differed by overdose history and homelessness status using ordered logistic regression and Pearson's χ2 -tests of independence.
RESULTS: Participants (34.2 [±8.3 SD] years of age, 68.5\% male, 85.9\% white, 8.2\% Hispanic) reported being most likely to use SIFs that provided safety from police intervention (86.7\%), entry into withdrawal management (85.9\%), or clean needles (83.2\%). Drug works disposal and safety from police were particularly important for PWID with a history of overdose.
CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, treatment-seeking PWIDs reported greater willingness to utilize SIFs if particular services were provided. These findings point to features of SIFs that may enhance treatment-seeking PWID's amenability to utilizing these services if such sites open in the United States. (Am J Addict 2021;30:21-25).},

	abstract = {Long-acting injectable HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAI-PrEP) could help overcome multilevel challenges to HIV prevention for people who inject drugs (PWID), including those in the binational San Diego-Tijuana metroplex. Yet, general PrEP awareness and interest in LAI-PrEP remain underexplored among PWID. From 2020 to 2021, 562 HIV-negative PWID in San Diego and Tijuana completed surveys assessing general PrEP awareness and interest in oral and LAI-PrEP. Modified Poisson regression examined factors associated with general PrEP awareness. Multinomial logistic regression assessed factors associated with interest in both oral and LAI-PrEP, oral PrEP only, LAI-PrEP only, or neither. General PrEP awareness was low (18\%) and associated with experiencing unsheltered homelessness (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-2.33), past 6-month fentanyl injection (APR = 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.04-2.25), and transactional sex (APR = 1.71, 95\% CI: 1.06-2.76). Interest in oral PrEP only was most common (44\%), followed by LAI-PrEP only (25\%) and neither (16\%). Compared to the odds of being interested in LAI-PrEP only, the odds of being interested in oral PrEP only were lower among those who were stopped by police (AOR = 0.38, 95\% CI: 0.22-0.65), reported past 6-month fentanyl injection (AOR = 0.33, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.56), polydrug use (AOR = 0.48, 95\% CI: 0.27-0.86), injecting multiple times daily (AOR = 0.26, 95\% CI: 0.14-0.46), receptive syringe use (AOR = 0.30, 95\% CI: 0.19-0.49), and higher perceived HIV risk (AOR = 0.24, 95\% CI: 0.15-0.39). Interest in LAI-PrEP was more common among PWID reporting social and structural factors that could interfere with oral PrEP adherence, suggesting LAI-PrEP implementation could increase PrEP coverage among those most vulnerable to HIV.},

HIV DNA + and HIV RNA + cells have also been observed in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with sustained cART suppression. In this review, we provide an overview of how HIV invades the brain and HIV infection of resident brain glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). We also discuss the role of resident glial cells in persistent neuroinflammation and HAND in PLWH and their potential contribution to the HIV reservoir. HIV eradication strategies that target persistently infected glia cells will likely be needed to achieve HIV cure.},

The trajectory of HIV-related inflammation may vary with the timing of ART initiation. We examined immune activation markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens collected over 96 weeks from participants who initiated ART during acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods RV254/SEARCH010 study participants with AHI underwent CSF (n = 89) and plasma (n = 146) sampling before initiating ART and at weeks 24 and 96 of treatment. A majority participants (64.4\%) received a standard ART regimen (hereafter, “standard ART”), with some (34.7\%) also receiving maraviroc and raltegravir for the first 24 weeks (hereafter, “ART plus”). We compared neopterin, CXCL10, CCL2, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in the AHI group to those in 18 healthy, uninfected controls. Results Following 24 and 96 weeks of treatment, levels of all CSF markers normalized while levels of several plasma markers remained elevated in the AHI group (P {\textbackslash}textless .001). Participants receiving the ART-plus regimen had lower median plasma CCL2 levels at week 24 and lower plasma neopterin levels at week 96. Conclusions ART initiation during AHI differentially impacts the brain compartment, with markers of inflammation returning to normal levels in the CSF, where they were sustained at week 96, but not in plasma.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              Early systemic and central nervous system viral replication and inflammation may affect brain integrity in people with HIV, leading to chronic cognitive symptoms not fully reversed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study examined associations between cognitive performance and markers of CNS injury associated with acute HIV infection and ART.
            
            
              Methods:
              HIV-infected MSM and transgender women (average age: 27 years and education: 13 years) enrolled within 100 days from the estimated date of detectable infection (EDDI). A cognitive performance (NP) protocol was administered at enrollment (before ART initiation) and every 24 weeks until week 192. An overall index of cognitive performance (NPZ) was created using local normative data. Blood (n = 87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 29) biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal injury were examined before ART initiation. Regression analyses assessed relationships between time since EDDI, pre-ART biomarkers, and NPZ.
            
            
              Results:
              Adjusting for multiple comparisons, shorter time since EDDI was associated with higher pre-ART VL and multiple biomarkers in plasma and CSF. NPZ scores were within the normative range at baseline (NPZ = 0.52) and at each follow-up visit, with a modest increase through week 192. Plasma or CSF biomarkers were not correlated with NP scores at baseline or after ART.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Biomarkers of CNS inflammation, immune activation, and neuronal injury peak early and then decline during acute HIV infection, confirming and extending results of other studies. Neither plasma nor CSF biomarkers during acute infection corresponded to NP scores before or after sustained ART in this cohort with few psychosocial risk factors for cognitive impairment.},

This was based on the original model constructed by Kaplan (1989) which analyses the behaviour of HIV/AIDS amongst a population of PWIDs. We derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the fraction of PWIDs who are infected with HIV at time. The stochasticity is introduced using the well-known standard technique of parameter perturbation. We first prove that the resulting SDE for the fraction of infected PWIDs has a unique solution in (0, 1) provided that some infected PWIDs are initially present and next construct the conditions required for extinction and persistence. Furthermore, we show that there exists a stationary distribution for the persistence case. Simulations using realistic parameter values are then constructed to illustrate and support our theoretical results. Our results provide new insight into the spread of HIV amongst PWIDs. The results show that the introduction of stochastic noise into a model for the spread of HIV amongst PWIDs can cause the disease to die out in scenarios where deterministic models predict disease persistence.},

To evaluate this historical conjecture, we develop a new graph-theoretic measure that quantifies the extent to which Friedman’s firewall hypothesis (FH) holds in a risk network. We compute this new measure across simulated trajectories of a stochastic discrete dynamical system that models a social network of 25,000 individuals engaging in risk acts over a period of 15 years. The model’s parameters are based on analyses of data collected in prior studies of the real-world risk networks of people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City. Analysis of system trajectories reveals the structural mechanisms by which individuals with mature HIV infections tend to partition the network into homogeneous clusters (with respect to infection status) and how uninfected clusters remain relatively stable (with respect to infection status) over long stretches of time. We confirm the spontaneous emergence of network firewalls in the system and reveal their structural role in the nonspreading of HIV.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              A recent HIV outbreak in a rural network of persons who inject drugs (PWID) underscored the intersection of the expanding epidemics of opioid abuse, unsterile injection drug use (IDU), and associated increases in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We sought to identify US communities potentially vulnerable to rapid spread of HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high rates of HCV infections among PWID.
            
            
              Design:
              We conducted a multistep analysis to identify indicator variables highly associated with IDU. We then used these indicator values to calculate vulnerability scores for each county to identify which were most vulnerable.
            
            
              Methods:
              We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 2012–2013, as a proxy outcome for IDU, and 15 county-level indicators available nationally in Poisson regression models to identify indicators associated with higher county acute HCV infection rates. Using these indicators, we calculated composite index scores to rank each county's vulnerability.
            
            
              Results:
              A parsimonious set of 6 indicators were associated with acute HCV infection rates (proxy for IDU): drug-overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales, per capita income, white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, unemployment, and buprenorphine prescribing potential by waiver. Based on these indicators, we identified 220 counties in 26 states within the 95th percentile of most vulnerable.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our analysis highlights US counties potentially vulnerable to HIV and HCV infections among PWID in the context of the national opioid epidemic. State and local health departments will need to further explore vulnerability and target interventions to prevent transmission.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              Methamphetamine use is once again on the rise among sexual and gender minorities who have sex with men (SGMSM).
            
            
              Methods:
              Baseline and 12-month data are taken from an ongoing cohort study of n = 4786 SGMSM aged 16–49 at risk for HIV from across the United States. Participants completed annual online surveys and at-home HIV testing (oral fluid samples returned through mail).
            
            
              Results:
              Overall, 2.47 per 100 persons seroconverted over 12 months. In addition, 13.8\% of participants reported any methamphetamine use over the 12-month study period. Nearly three-fourths (74.7\%; 422 of 565) of those who reported using methamphetamine at baseline were persistent users at 12 months. In adjusted analyses, compared with those who did not use methamphetamine, incident methamphetamine users (ie, those who indicated use between baseline and follow-up) and persistent methamphetamine users had significantly higher odds of HIV seroconverting (adjusted odds ratio = 3.95, 95\% confidence interval: 1.64 to 9.47; and 7.11, 4.53 to 11.17, respectively). Persistent methamphetamine users accounted for one-third of all observed HIV seroconversions (41 of 115).
            
            
              Discussion:
              Among SGMSM at elevated risk for HIV, persistent methamphetamine use was prevalent and associated with substantially amplified risk for HIV seroconversion. Expanded efforts are needed to test implementation strategies for scalable, evidence-based interventions to reduce HIV risk in SGMSM who use methamphetamine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In King County, Washington, the HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) who inject methamphetamine is high, while it is low among other people who inject drugs (PWID). Local drug problem indicators suggest that methamphetamine use is increasing. The extent to which this increase affects MSM and non-MSM, and whether MSM and non-MSM networks are connected through injection equipment sharing, is unknown.
METHODS: We used data from two serial cross-sectional surveys of PWID including five biannual surveys of Public Health-Seattle and King County Needle and Syringe Exchange Program clients (NSEP, N=2135, 2009-2017) and three National HIV Behavioral Surveillance IDU surveys (NHBS, N=1709, 2009-2015).
RESULTS: The proportion of non-MSM PWID reporting any recent methamphetamine injection increased significantly from approximately 20\% in 2009 to 65\% in 2017. Most of this increase was attributable to injecting methamphetamine in combination with heroin (goofballs). PWID who injected goofballs were more likely to be younger, homeless or unstably housed, report daily injection, and self-report an opioid overdose in the past year than other PWID. The majority of PWID who injected methamphetamine reported sharing any injection equipment. Among these PWID, 43\% of MSM had last shared injection equipment with a non-MSM. Eight percent of non-MSM men and 15\% of women had last shared equipment with an MSM.
CONCLUSIONS: Given non-trivial rates of sharing injection equipment with methamphetamine-using MSM, a population with an HIV prevalence of 40\%, non-MSM who inject methamphetamine could be an emerging population at risk for acquiring HIV.},

This time-space cluster took place in a region with a syndemic of homelessness and drug use. The investigation included new HIV diagnoses in 2018, 2019, and 2020 in Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties. Public health response included activating incident command, development and implementation of an enhanced interview tool, outreach testing, and stakeholder engagement. We identified 396 new cases of HIV infection, 116 (29\%) of which met the cluster definition. Most cluster cases had no molecular relationships to previous cases. Persons responding to the enhanced interview tool reported behaviors associated with HIV acquisition. Field outreach testing did not identify any new HIV cases but did identify hepatitis C and syphilis infections. We show the importance of a robust public health response to a time-space cluster of new HIV infections in an urban area.},
