	abstract = {Objectives:
              National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) conducts surveillance among key populations, including persons who inject drugs (PWID). NHBS data can be used to monitor progress toward national goals, including Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). EHE strategies include HIV testing (Diagnose), rapid linkage to HIV treatment (Treat), and increasing access to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and syringe services programs (SSPs) (Prevent). This analysis aimed to concisely compare NHBS key findings among PWID to EHE goals.
            
            
              Design/methods:
              
                Cross-sectional NHBS data were collected from PWID in 2018 (
                n
                 = 9786) and 2022 (
                n
                 = 6574) in 19 US cities. We compared key findings from 2022 NHBS to specified EHE goals for Diagnose (HIV testing) and Treat (linkage to care, current antiretroviral therapy (ART) use) or 2018 NHBS key findings for Prevent (PrEP and SSP use).
              
            
            
              Results:
              In 2022, 45\% of PWID were tested for HIV; 45\% of PWID with HIV were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis, and 79\% were currently taking ART; 1\% of PWID without HIV used PrEP; and approximately half of all PWID received syringes from an SSP. PrEP and SSP use among PWID have not changed since 2018.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              National HIV strategies are not yet adequately reaching PWID. To end the US HIV epidemic, multilevel solutions are needed to tailor interventions for PWID and dismantle barriers to testing, treatment, and prevention. Structural solutions to improve access to basic needs and SSPs may have downstream benefits across the EHE strategies.},

	abstract = {This editorial review covers current trends in the epidemiology of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, including four recent HIV outbreaks. We discuss gaps in the prevention and treatment cascades for HIV and medications for opioid disorder and propose lessons learned to prevent future HIV outbreaks. Over the last decade, North America has been in the throes of a major opioid epidemic, due in part to over-prescribing of prescription opiates, followed by increasing availability of cheap heroin, synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl), and stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine). Historically, HIV infection among PWID in the US had predominantly affected communities who were older, urban and Black. More recently, the majority of these infections are among younger, rural or suburban and Caucasian PWID. All four HIV outbreaks were characterized by a high proportion of women who inject drugs and underlying socioeconomic drivers such as homelessness and poverty. We contend that the US response to the HIV epidemic among PWID has been fractured. A crucial lesson is that when evidence-based responses to HIV prevention are undermined or abandoned because of moral objections, untold humanitarian and financial costs on public health will ensue. Restructuring a path forward requires that evidence-based interventions be integrated and brought to scale while simultaneously addressing underlying structural drivers of HIV and related syndemics. Failing to do so will mean that HIV outbreaks among PWID and the communities they live in will continue to occur in a tragic and relentless cycle.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              A recent HIV outbreak in a rural network of persons who inject drugs (PWID) underscored the intersection of the expanding epidemics of opioid abuse, unsterile injection drug use (IDU), and associated increases in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We sought to identify US communities potentially vulnerable to rapid spread of HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high rates of HCV infections among PWID.
            
            
              Design:
              We conducted a multistep analysis to identify indicator variables highly associated with IDU. We then used these indicator values to calculate vulnerability scores for each county to identify which were most vulnerable.
            
            
              Methods:
              We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 2012–2013, as a proxy outcome for IDU, and 15 county-level indicators available nationally in Poisson regression models to identify indicators associated with higher county acute HCV infection rates. Using these indicators, we calculated composite index scores to rank each county's vulnerability.
            
            
              Results:
              A parsimonious set of 6 indicators were associated with acute HCV infection rates (proxy for IDU): drug-overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales, per capita income, white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, unemployment, and buprenorphine prescribing potential by waiver. Based on these indicators, we identified 220 counties in 26 states within the 95th percentile of most vulnerable.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our analysis highlights US counties potentially vulnerable to HIV and HCV infections among PWID in the context of the national opioid epidemic. State and local health departments will need to further explore vulnerability and target interventions to prevent transmission.},

            Prevention of HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs remains a challenge to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The first legal syringe services program (SSP) in Florida implemented routine screening in 2018 leading to the identification of ten anonymous HIV seroconversions. The SSP collaborated with the Department of Health to conduct an epidemiologic investigation. All seven acute HIV seroconversions were linked to care (86\% within 30 days) and achieved viral suppression (mean 70 days). Six of the seven individuals are epidemiologically and/or socially linked to at least two other seroconversions. Analysis of the HIV genotypes revealed that two individuals are connected molecularly at 0.5\% genetic distance. We identified a risk network with complex transmission dynamics that could not be explained by epidemiological methods or molecular analyses alone. Providing wrap-around services through the SSP, including routine screening, intensive linkage and patient navigation, could be an effective model for achieving viral suppression for people who inject drugs.

            Resumen
            La prevención de brotes de VIH entre las personas que se inyectan drogas sigue siendo un desafío para poner fin a la epidemia de VIH en los Estados Unidos. El primer programa legal de servicios de intercambio de jeringas (SSP como se conoce con sus siglas en inglés) en Florida, implementó pruebas rutinarias en 2018 que condujo a la identificación de diez seroconversiones anónimas de VIH. El SSP colaboró ​​con el Departamento de Salud para realizar una investigación epidemiológica. Siete seroconversiones agudas de VIH fueron identificadas y se vincularon a la atención médica (86\% en 30 días) y lograron la supresión viral (media 70 días). Seis de los siete individuos están vinculados epidemiológicamente y/o socialmente con al menos otras dos seroconversiones. El análisis de los genotipos del VIH reveló que dos individuos están conectados molecularmente a una distancia genética de 0.5\%. Identificamos una red de riesgo con una dinámica de transmisión compleja que no puede explicarse solamente con métodos epidemiológicos o análisis moleculares. Brindando servicios integrales a través del SSP, que incluyan pruebas de rutina, el enlace intensivo y la navegación del paciente, podría ser un modelo eficaz para lograr la supresión viral de las personas que se inyectan drogas.},

HIV uninfected, at risk PWID, could likely benefit from long-acting injectable formulations of PrEP ("LAI-PrEP"); however, its acceptability in this population has not been previously documented. Thirty-three HIV-uninfected PWID in the U.S. Northeast completed an in-depth interview regarding perceived acceptability of LAI-PrEP. Coded data were synthesized using deductive thematic analysis. The majority of PWID interviewed believed LAI-PrEP would be acceptable. Participants perceived that receiving injections every two months would reduce barriers to daily oral PrEP adherence, including forgetting while "high" and safeguarding pills when homeless. A few participants expressed concerns regarding LAI-PrEP, including medical mistrust, a concern that injections could alter their "high" or be "triggering" for PWID. LAI-PrEP has the potential to reduce HIV among PWID; however, their perspectives are largely absent from research examining its efficacy, representing a missed opportunity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is clinically efficacious and recommended for HIV prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID), but uptake remains low and intervention needs are understudied. To inform the development of PrEP interventions for PWID, we conducted a qualitative study in the Northeastern USA, a region where recent clusters of new HIV infections have been attributed to injection drug use.
METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 33 HIV-uninfected PWID (hereafter, "participants") and 12 clinical and social service providers (professional "key informants") in Boston, MA, and Providence, RI, in 2017. Trained interviewers used semi-structured interviews to explore PrEP acceptability and perceived barriers to use. Thematic analysis of coded data identified multilevel barriers to PrEP use among PWID and related intervention strategies.
RESULTS: Among PWID participants (n = 33, 55\% male), interest in PrEP was high, but both participants and professional key informants (n = 12) described barriers to PrEP utilization that occurred at one or more socioecological levels. Individual-level barriers included low PrEP knowledge and limited HIV risk perception, concerns about PrEP side effects, and competing health priorities and needs due to drug use and dependence. Interpersonal-level barriers included negative experiences with healthcare providers and HIV-related stigma within social networks. Clinical barriers included poor infrastructure and capacity for PrEP delivery to PWID, and structural barriers related to homelessness, criminal justice system involvement, and lack of money or identification to get prescriptions. Participants and key informants provided some suggestions for strategies to address these multilevel barriers and better facilitate PrEP delivery to PWID.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to some of the facilitators of PrEP use identified by participants and key informants, we drew on our key findings and behavioral change theory to propose additional intervention targets. In particular, to help address the multilevel barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence, we discuss ways that interventions could target information, self-regulation and self-efficacy, social support, and environmental change. PrEP is clinically efficacious and has been recommended for PWID; thus, development and testing of strategies to improve PrEP delivery to this high-risk and socially marginalized population are needed.},

Despite high levels of need, multilevel barriers to accessing antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention persist for this population. The Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) initiated a low-threshold, outreach-based program to support engagement in PrEP services among PWID experiencing homelessness.
METHODS: To inform dissemination efforts, we explored patient and provider perspectives on key program components. From March to December 2020, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with current and former BHCHP PrEP program participants and prescribers, patient navigators, and outreach workers (i.e., providers). Thematic analysis explored perspectives on key program components.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 21) and providers (n = 11) identified the following five key components of BHCHP's PrEP program that they perceived to be particularly helpful for supporting patient engagement in PrEP services: (1) community-driven PrEP education; (2) low-threshold, accessible programming including same-day PrEP prescribing; (3) tailored prescribing supports (e.g., on-site pharmacy, short-term prescriptions, medication storage); (4) intensive outreach and navigation; and (5) trusting, respectful patient-provider relationships.
DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that more patient-centered services formed the basis of BHCHP's innovative, successful PrEP program. While contextual challenges including competing public health emergencies and homeless encampment "sweeps" necessitate ongoing programmatic adaptations, lessons from BHCHP's PrEP program can inform PrEP delivery in a range of community-based settings serving this population, including syringe service programs and shelters.},

Improving PrEP uptake in this population will require understanding of PrEP knowledge and interest. In 2017, we conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with HIV-uninfected PWID and key informants (PrEP and harm reduction providers) in the US Northeast. Thematic analysis of coded data explored PrEP knowledge and the factors that influence PrEP interest. Among PWID (n = 33), median age was 36 years, 55\% were male, 67\% were white, and 24\% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Accurate PrEP knowledge among PWID was low, which key informants (n = 12) attributed to PrEP marketing focused on other risk populations, as well as healthcare providers' lack of time and unwillingness to discuss PrEP with PWID. There was a discrepancy between self-reported HIV risk behaviors, which were common, and HIV risk perceptions, which varied and strongly influenced PrEP interest. Most PWID and key informants thought that PrEP would be most beneficial for those who shared syringes, used discarded syringes, engaged in transactional sex, or were homeless. Improving uptake of PrEP for HIV prevention among high-risk PWID will require education to increase PrEP knowledge and addressing factors that negatively influence PrEP interest such as perceptions regarding low HIV risk and the process for obtaining PrEP. This may require specialized PrEP marketing and outreach efforts and improved capacity of healthcare providers to effectively assess HIV risk (and perceptions) and communicate the benefits of PrEP to at-risk PWID.},
