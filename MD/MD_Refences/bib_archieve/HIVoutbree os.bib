	abstract = {This editorial review covers current trends in the epidemiology of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, including four recent HIV outbreaks. We discuss gaps in the prevention and treatment cascades for HIV and medications for opioid disorder and propose lessons learned to prevent future HIV outbreaks. Over the last decade, North America has been in the throes of a major opioid epidemic, due in part to over-prescribing of prescription opiates, followed by increasing availability of cheap heroin, synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl), and stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine). Historically, HIV infection among PWID in the US had predominantly affected communities who were older, urban and Black. More recently, the majority of these infections are among younger, rural or suburban and Caucasian PWID. All four HIV outbreaks were characterized by a high proportion of women who inject drugs and underlying socioeconomic drivers such as homelessness and poverty. We contend that the US response to the HIV epidemic among PWID has been fractured. A crucial lesson is that when evidence-based responses to HIV prevention are undermined or abandoned because of moral objections, untold humanitarian and financial costs on public health will ensue. Restructuring a path forward requires that evidence-based interventions be integrated and brought to scale while simultaneously addressing underlying structural drivers of HIV and related syndemics. Failing to do so will mean that HIV outbreaks among PWID and the communities they live in will continue to occur in a tragic and relentless cycle.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              We conducted a medical record review for healthcare utilization, risk factors, and clinical data among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Massachusetts to aid HIV outbreak response decision-making and strengthen public health practice.
            
            
              Setting
              Two large community health centers (CHCs) that provide HIV and related services in northeastern Massachusetts.
            
            
              Methods
              Between May and July 2018, we reviewed medical records for 88 people with HIV (PWH) connected to the outbreak. The review period included care received from May 1, 2016, through the date of review. Surveillance data were used to establish date of HIV diagnosis and assess viral suppression.
            
            
              Results
              Sixty-nine (78\%) people had HIV infection diagnosed during the review period, including 10 acute infections. Persons had a median of 3 primary care visits after HIV diagnosis and zero before diagnosis. During the review period, 72\% reported active drug or alcohol use, 62\% were prescribed medication assisted treatment, and 41\% were prescribed antidepressants. The majority (68, 77\%) had a documented ART prescription. HIV viral suppression at {\textless} 200 copies/mL was more frequent (73\%) than the overall across the State (65\%); it did not correlate with any of the sociodemographic characteristics studied in our population. Over half (57\%) had been hospitalized at least once during the review period, and 36\% had a bacterial infection at hospitalization.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Medical record review with a field investigation of an outbreak provided data about patterns of health care utilization and comorbidities not available from routine HIV surveillance or case interviews. Integration of HIV screening with treatment for HIV and SUD can strengthen prevention and care services for PWID in northeastern Massachusetts.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              A recent HIV outbreak in a rural network of persons who inject drugs (PWID) underscored the intersection of the expanding epidemics of opioid abuse, unsterile injection drug use (IDU), and associated increases in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We sought to identify US communities potentially vulnerable to rapid spread of HIV, if introduced, and new or continuing high rates of HCV infections among PWID.
            
            
              Design:
              We conducted a multistep analysis to identify indicator variables highly associated with IDU. We then used these indicator values to calculate vulnerability scores for each county to identify which were most vulnerable.
            
            
              Methods:
              We used confirmed cases of acute HCV infection reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, 2012–2013, as a proxy outcome for IDU, and 15 county-level indicators available nationally in Poisson regression models to identify indicators associated with higher county acute HCV infection rates. Using these indicators, we calculated composite index scores to rank each county's vulnerability.
            
            
              Results:
              A parsimonious set of 6 indicators were associated with acute HCV infection rates (proxy for IDU): drug-overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales, per capita income, white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, unemployment, and buprenorphine prescribing potential by waiver. Based on these indicators, we identified 220 counties in 26 states within the 95th percentile of most vulnerable.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our analysis highlights US counties potentially vulnerable to HIV and HCV infections among PWID in the context of the national opioid epidemic. State and local health departments will need to further explore vulnerability and target interventions to prevent transmission.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Prevention of HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs remains a challenge to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The first legal syringe services program (SSP) in Florida implemented routine screening in 2018 leading to the identification of ten anonymous HIV seroconversions. The SSP collaborated with the Department of Health to conduct an epidemiologic investigation. All seven acute HIV seroconversions were linked to care (86\% within 30 days) and achieved viral suppression (mean 70 days). Six of the seven individuals are epidemiologically and/or socially linked to at least two other seroconversions. Analysis of the HIV genotypes revealed that two individuals are connected molecularly at 0.5\% genetic distance. We identified a risk network with complex transmission dynamics that could not be explained by epidemiological methods or molecular analyses alone. Providing wrap-around services through the SSP, including routine screening, intensive linkage and patient navigation, could be an effective model for achieving viral suppression for people who inject drugs.

            Resumen
            La prevención de brotes de VIH entre las personas que se inyectan drogas sigue siendo un desafío para poner fin a la epidemia de VIH en los Estados Unidos. El primer programa legal de servicios de intercambio de jeringas (SSP como se conoce con sus siglas en inglés) en Florida, implementó pruebas rutinarias en 2018 que condujo a la identificación de diez seroconversiones anónimas de VIH. El SSP colaboró ​​con el Departamento de Salud para realizar una investigación epidemiológica. Siete seroconversiones agudas de VIH fueron identificadas y se vincularon a la atención médica (86\% en 30 días) y lograron la supresión viral (media 70 días). Seis de los siete individuos están vinculados epidemiológicamente y/o socialmente con al menos otras dos seroconversiones. El análisis de los genotipos del VIH reveló que dos individuos están conectados molecularmente a una distancia genética de 0.5\%. Identificamos una red de riesgo con una dinámica de transmisión compleja que no puede explicarse solamente con métodos epidemiológicos o análisis moleculares. Brindando servicios integrales a través del SSP, que incluyan pruebas de rutina, el enlace intensivo y la navegación del paciente, podría ser un modelo eficaz para lograr la supresión viral de las personas que se inyectan drogas.},
