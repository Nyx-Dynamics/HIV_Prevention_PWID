## PART 1: Cross-Reference Updates for Manuscripts

### For Paper 3 (Structural Barriers) - Add to Introduction:

**Add after first paragraph:**
> This analysis extends the Prevention Theorem framework (Demidont, 2026), which establishes that R₀=0 is the only mathematically valid endpoint for HIV prevention, and builds upon the cascade paradigm shift described for long-acting injectable PrEP implementation (Demidont, 2025).

**🧵 THREAD: Four Papers, One Mission - Ending HIV Prevention Inequality**

I'm sharing a series of research publications that together make a mathematical case for transforming HIV prevention policy.

Over the past month, I've released four interconnected papers examining why highly effective HIV prevention drugs fail to protect the people who need them most.

The findings are uncomfortable but necessary:
• A 5,434-fold disparity in prevention outcomes between populations
• 93% of prevention failure attributable to policy, not biology
• A mathematical timestamp predicting system failure within 4 years

This isn't about blaming patients. It's about proving—mathematically—that our systems are the problem.

Papers 1 & 2 are now live on Preprints.org. Papers 3 & 4 are in review.

Follow along as I break down each paper's contribution to this framework.

### Post 2: Paper 1 - Bridging the Gap (Post Day 2)

**📄 Paper 1: Bridging the Gap - The PrEP Cascade Paradigm Shift**

🔗 DOI: 10.20944/preprints202512.2354.v1

Long-acting injectable PrEP (LAI-PrEP) was supposed to solve adherence problems. But implementation data tells a different story.

**The Problem:**
We're applying daily-pill thinking to a fundamentally different intervention. LAI-PrEP requires navigating healthcare systems every 2 months—systems that many high-risk populations cannot reliably access.

**Key Finding:**
The cascade model for LAI-PrEP success looks nothing like oral PrEP. Different barriers. Different failure points. Different solutions needed.

**What This Means:**
Until we redesign prevention infrastructure around how LAI-PrEP actually works, we'll continue seeing efficacy-effectiveness gaps that cost lives.

This paper establishes the framework. The next three quantify the consequences.

### Post 3: Paper 2 - The Prevention Theorem (Post Day 3)

**📄 Paper 2: The Prevention Theorem - Why R₀=0 Is the Only Valid Endpoint**

✅ Just accepted at Preprints.org (ID: 193601)

This paper asks a fundamental question: What does "prevention" actually mean mathematically?

**The Answer:**
Prevention requires R₀=0. Not "reduced risk." Not "lower incidence." Zero productive infections from each exposure.

**Why This Matters:**

For parenteral HIV exposure (injection), the biological window for intervention is 12-24 hours. After proviral integration, the infection is irreversible.

The Prevention Theorem proves that:
• Time-dependent constraints make prevention impossible after critical windows close
• Policy delays that exceed biological windows guarantee prevention failure
• "Partial prevention" is a contradiction in terms

**The Implication:**
Every hour of policy-induced delay converts a preventable exposure into an irreversible infection.

This isn't philosophy. It's virology translated into mathematics.

**📄 Paper 3: Structural Barriers Drive Near-Zero Prevention for PWID**

⏳ Currently in review at Preprints.org (ID: 193808)

This is the paper that quantifies the disparity.

**The Numbers:**

| Population | P(R₀=0) | Outcome |
|------------|---------|---------|
| MSM | 16.3% | Sustained protection achievable |
| PWID | 0.003% | Prevention functionally impossible |

**That's a 5,434-fold disparity.**

Same drugs. Same efficacy. Completely different outcomes.

**Barrier Decomposition:**
• Pathogen biology: 6.9%
• HIV testing: 6.9%  
• Architectural barriers: **93.1%**

Policy. Infrastructure. Stigma. Algorithms. Research exclusion.

**The 4-Year Timestamp:**
Monte Carlo simulations predict 63.3% probability of major outbreak within 5 years under current policy.

This isn't a prediction of what might happen. It's a calculation of what current policy trajectories produce.

### Post 5: Paper 4 - Algorithmic Bias (Post Day 5)

---

**📄 Paper 4: Algorithmic Bias as Digital Pathogen**

🔄 Currently resubmitted for review

The final piece: How machine learning amplifies exclusion.

**The Signal-to-Noise Problem:**

Healthcare ML algorithms are trained on historical data. For HIV prevention:
• MSM literature base: 9,180 publications
• PWID literature base: 76 publications

That's a **120-fold signal disparity** before any algorithm runs.

**What Happens:**
• Risk scores underestimate PWID vulnerability
• Allocation algorithms deprioritize PWID populations
• Clinical decision support systems encode historical bias
• The system perpetuates the exclusion that generated its training data

**The LOOCV Framework:**
PWID function as the "held-out test set" in HIV prevention research—systematically excluded from the trials that generate evidence, then blamed when interventions don't work.

This isn't a bug. It's a feature of how we've structured research and implementation.

**🎯 The Mathematical Case for Policy Change**

Six days. Four papers. One conclusion:

**HIV prevention failure among people who inject drugs is manufactured by policy, not determined by biology.**

The evidence:
✅ 5,434-fold disparity in prevention probability (same drugs, different systems)
✅ 93.1% of failure attributable to modifiable barriers
✅ 63.3% outbreak probability within 5 years under current policy
✅ 120-fold bias in the data training prevention algorithms

**What needs to change:**
1. Decriminalization of drug use
2. Healthcare integration with harm reduction services
3. Algorithmic auditing in clinical decision support
4. Research inclusion mandates for excluded populations

**The timestamp is running.**

Every day of policy inaction converts the theoretical 4-year window into lived consequences.
