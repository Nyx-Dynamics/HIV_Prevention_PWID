**🧵 Four Papers, One Framework: A Mathematical Case for HIV Prevention Policy Reform**

I'm releasing a series of interconnected research publications examining structural barriers to HIV prevention efficacy—with a focus on why highly effective biomedical interventions fail to protect marginalized populations.

**The Research Series:**

| # | Title | Status | ID |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Bridging the Gap: The PrEP Cascade Paradigm Shift for Long-Acting Injectable HIV Prevention | ✅ Published | DOI: 10.20944/preprints202512.2354.v1 |
| 2 | The Prevention Theorem: Time-Dependent Constraints on Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV | ✅ Accepted | Preprints ID: 193601 |
| 3 | Structural Barriers, Stochastic Avoidance, and Outbreak Risk in HIV Prevention for PWID | ⏳ In Review | Preprints ID: 193808 |
| 4 | Computational Validation of Clinical Decision Support Algorithm for LAI-PrEP Bridge Period | 🔄 Resubmitted | — |

**Peer Review Submissions:**
- Papers 1 & 2 → *Viruses* (MDPI)
- Paper 2 → *Epidemics* (Elsevier)
- Paper 3 → *BMC Public Health* (Springer)

**Key Findings:**
• 5,434-fold disparity in prevention outcomes (MSM vs PWID)
• 93.1% of prevention failure attributable to structural barriers
• 63.3% probability of major outbreak within 5 years under current policy

**Research Update: Structural Determinants of HIV Prevention Failure Among Marginalized Populations**

I am pleased to announce the release of a four-paper research series examining the mathematical and structural constraints on HIV prevention efficacy, with particular focus on populations experiencing systematic exclusion from biomedical interventions.

**Publication Summary:**

1. **Demidont AC.** Bridging the Gap: The PrEP Cascade Paradigm Shift for Long-Acting Injectable HIV Prevention. *Preprints.* 2025;2025122354. DOI: [10.20944/preprints202512.2354.v1](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202512.2354.v1). *Submitted for peer review: Viruses (MDPI).*

2. **Demidont AC.** The Prevention Theorem: Time-Dependent Constraints on Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV. *Preprints.* 2026;193601. [Accepted]. *Submitted for peer review: Epidemics (Elsevier).*

3. **Demidont AC.** Structural Barriers, Stochastic Avoidance, and Outbreak Risk in HIV Prevention for People Who Inject Drugs. *Preprints.* 2026;193808. [In Review]. *Submitted for peer review: BMC Public Health (Springer).*

4. **Demidont AC.** Computational Validation of Clinical Decision Support Algorithm for LAI-PrEP Bridge Period Navigation at UNAIDS Global Target Scale. [Resubmitted]. *Submitted for peer review: Viruses (MDPI).*

**Abstract Summary:**

This research program employs Monte Carlo simulation, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and stochastic modeling to demonstrate that HIV prevention failure among people who inject drugs (PWID) is predominantly attributable to modifiable structural barriers rather than biological constraints. Key findings include a 5,434-fold disparity in prevention cascade completion between MSM and PWID populations, with 93.1% of failure attributable to policy, infrastructure, stigma, and algorithmic factors. Outbreak probability modeling indicates 63.3% (95% CI: 60.1–66.5%) likelihood of major HIV outbreak within 5 years under current policy trajectories.
